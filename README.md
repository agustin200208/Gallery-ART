Hello there, this is a work in progress Gallery Art where you can see paints, you select the paint that you like and the program will show you some information about it, and you also can buy it through OpenSea as an NFT. To create this project I use HTML, CSS and JS, here you can see it https://agustin200208.github.io/Gallery-ART/
